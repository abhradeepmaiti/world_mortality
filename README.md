# Weekly/monthly mortality 2015--2021

This repository contains country-level data on all-cause mortality collected from various sources, see below. Please note:

* Our aim is to provide data from 2015 onwards. In some cases the coverage starts later, but we require at least full 2019 data.
* Countries are only included if the data exist until at least June 2020. 
* We only collect weekly, monthly, or quarterly data. 
* We only provide all-cause mortality numbers, without splitting by age or gender.
* We only provide country-level data, without splitting it by regions or individual cities.
* The data for the European countries are sourced from the EuroStat **(LINK NEEDED)**.
* The Short Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) dataset from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org) (HMD) is integrated into this dataset.

We welcome any contributions.

Weekly data mostly follow ISO8601 standard, when weeks are calendar weeks, Monday to Sunday, and the weeks on the year boundaries are assigned to the year in which they have more days (four or more). Most years have 52 weeks but some years, such as 2015, will have 53 weeks. Some countries provide weekly data starting weeks from January 1st, irrespective of week day. This is specified in the data table.
