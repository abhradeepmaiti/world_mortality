# Weekly/monthly mortality 2015--2021

This repository contains country-level data on all-cause mortality collected from various sources, see below. Please note:

* Our aim is to provide data from 2015 onwards but in some cases the coverage starts later. 
* Countries are only included if the data exist until at least June 2020. 
* We only collect weekly, monthly, or quarterly data. 
* We only provide all-cause mortality numbers, without splitting by age or gender.
* We only provide country-level data, without splitting it by regions or individual cities.
* The Short Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) dataset from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org) (HMD) is integrated into this dataset.

We welcome any contributions.

The data are provided in Solar Hirji seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). Winter starts on Dec 22, so we count it as the next calendar year (e.g. Winter 1393 as the first entry for 2015).
